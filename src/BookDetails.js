This is great especially if you're unfamiliar with the Mahabharata. However, Dharma himself admits that this is no scholarly translation. I recommend that you also read other abridgements as well to get a full scope of the story. While the action in this version is well articulated, some of the inbetween discussions and descriptions seem to be a bit drawn-out. I say this in comparison with other versions. For instance, absolutely way too much forshadowing is given.",

An idealized heroic tale about the struggle between good and evil, the Ramayana is also an intensely personal story of family relationships, love and loss, duty and honour, of harem intrigue, petty jealousies and destructive ambitions—all this played out in a universe populated by larger-than-life humans, gods and celestial beings, wondrous animals and terrifying demons.",
